            Hello, my name is Boi Boi.
            During secondary school, I was quite timid. That is the reason why I spent 100% of concentration on study
            and missed many interesting extra-curricular activities at school. However, I then decided to step out of my
            safe zone and chose Ngo Gia Tu High School - an education establishment full of dynamism to enter. Right
            from the start, I aimed to self-develop by joining many clubs. And this decision truly helped me to enrich
            myself comprehensively with a variety of skills, diminish my timidity and become an energetic individual who
            can contribute to the school. I see that our university is also a dynamic university and I believe that I
            can thrive again an opportunity to study in that university is offered.
        </p>
        <p class="crimson-pro-font bg-primary text-white">
            Growing up in an environment where creativity was always encouraged, I discovered my passion for
            communication at an early age.
            I believe communication is not just a field of study but also a powerful tool to convey emotions, share
            stories, and influence perceptions.
