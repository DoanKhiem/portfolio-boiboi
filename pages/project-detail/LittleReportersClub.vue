                We’ve all heard someone hum this saying: “Every person’s life is a jigsaw puzzle, and every piece has a
                reason to exist."
                Indeed, you and Little Reporter have found each other, and from this moment on, you will be pieces of
                each other's puzzle. A “key” piece holds countless surprises yet to be revealed, waiting for you to
                unlock the door and embark on a meaningful journey together.
                Welcome to the Little Reporter family!

                    The Phu Yen Province Club - Team - Group Festival was a meaningful day, bringing together over 100
                    students to participate in bonding activities. The morning featured dynamic games such as group flag
                    decoration, ball passing, intellectual challenges, and "Ring the Golden Bell." These warm-up
                    activities created a cheerful atmosphere, bringing participants closer together and transforming
                    strangers into friends.

                On October 25, 2024, the Little Reporter Club was honored to attend the Volunteer Collaboration
                Conference of Phu Yen Radio and Television Station.
                <br>
                <br>
                The club had the opportunity to meet the station's collaborators, listen to their insights,
                directions, and the hopes and aspirations of the leadership. Additionally, we were moved by a very
                touching song that inspired everyone in the audience with a spirit of "love for the country -
                compassion for others," leaving us with a deep sense of longing encapsulated in the three words
                "gratitude for people".
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, we were extremely happy and proud to be one of the seven organizations recognized for
                outstanding contributions in collaboration during the 2023-2024 year. We hope that in the upcoming
                2024-2025 period, the Little Reporter Club will continue to grow strong and be a team known for its
                high-quality publications!

                On February 7th, the Little Reporter Club organized a charity event to distribute Tet gifts, including
                packs of candies and essential goods, to those in need in Tuy Hoa City. The funds for this event came
                from the sale of lucky money envelopes and bracelets that we had organized earlier. Each gift given was
                wrapped with a bit of our love, and at the same time, it served as a seed—small, yet we believe it will
                bring happiness to the elderly and the disadvantaged during this Lunar New Year.

                Sometimes, doing good is not as difficult as you think. Just a small word of encouragement can bring joy
                and warmth to others!
                <br>
                Now, let’s take a moment to look back at the memorable moments we've shared!

                    On the evening of July 6th, the Little Reporters Club was present at April 1 Square to "engage in
                    hands-on practice" and gather news and stories from the 27th Pink Lotus Festival in 2024—one of the
                    major events of the province and the region. During last night's rehearsal, the Little Reporters
                    collaborated to produce engaging articles, capture stunning photos, and create an intriguing
                    reportage.

                    The Little Reporters Club is honored to be guided by the Youth Activity Center and to independently
                    gather news during this event.
