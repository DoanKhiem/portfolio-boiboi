                    On 8th and 9th December, “Dong Khong Lanh”- a fundraising event that has been
                    cherished for a long time
                    with the desire to spread “winter warmth” to everyone and together create truly worthwhile moments
                    was
                    held, where teenagers can buy environmentally friendly handmade products and enjoy an acoustic music
                    night. Through the event, we wanted to convey a message about spreading love and warmth to people
                    around
                    us more; love has the unimaginable power, it saves humans from a savage life.

                    With the desire to create a warm and joyful Mid-Autumn Festival for the children, warmth that comes
                    not
                    only from the lovely lanterns and packets of cakes and candies but also from the heartfelt effort to
                    create a playground filled with laughter, helping them cherish the most wonderful memories of the
                    festival night. With these aspirations, CAM collaborated with Xanh Camping to organize an event
                    where
                    the children could play freely and enjoy an unforgettable Mid-Autumn night.

                    During the time we participated in previous events, we had the opportunity to learn about these
                    extraordinary individuals. They are the ones who, despite challenges, quietly and selflessly
                    dedicate themselves to society. This has made us truly appreciate and feel grateful to them,
                    inspiring us to embrace this project with the hope of sharing a bit of our compassion and bringing
                    them a warm and joyful Lunar New Year.
