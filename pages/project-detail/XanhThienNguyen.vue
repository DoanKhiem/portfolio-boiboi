                    This meaningful action by Xanh Thiá»‡n Nguyá»‡n and Compassion Journey was honored to be recorded and

                The activity takes place every day, every week, with Xanh and local volunteers participating in cleaning
                the beaches in the area. People come from different places, of all ages, but they arrive early to work
                together in cleaning the beach, creating a truly green environment with great trust and spirit. Not only
                stopping at cleaning the beach, the group also planted coastal protection trees at locations where they
                had been planted before (such as sea almond trees and cacti), bringing hope for the future of the
                coastal ecosystem.ðŸŒ±

                Xanh is deeply grateful and appreciative of everyone. By acting together, showing unity, support, and
                sharing practical values, they have made a meaningful impact on the people in the land of Phu, under the
                peaceful sky of Yen

                Bringing the message of kindness closer to everyone is the way Xanh is carrying out its mission.
                Protecting ourselves to create the life we dream of, let's go with Xanh.

                    With the desire to create a warm and joyful Mid-Autumn Festival for the children, warmth that comes
                    not
                    only from the lovely lanterns and packets of cakes and candies but also from the heartfelt effort to
                    create a playground filled with laughter, helping them cherish the most wonderful memories of the
                    festival night. With these aspirations, CAM collaborated with Xanh Camping to organize an event
                    where
                    the children could play freely and enjoy an unforgettable Mid-Autumn night.
