                    On November 3rd, Xanh Thien Nguyen and the Compassion Journey Club (Le Trung Kien High School - Dong
                    Hoa) carried out a beach clean-up and tree planting activity at Phu Tho Fishing Village, Dong Hoa.
                    This meaningful action by Xanh Thien Nguyen and Compassion Journey was honored to be recorded and
                    broadcast on the national television channel VTV1.

                The activity takes place every day, every week, with Xanh and local volunteers participating in cleaning
                the beaches in the area. People come from different places, of all ages, but they arrive early to work
                together in cleaning the beach, creating a truly green environment with great trust and spirit. Not only
                stopping at cleaning the beach, the group also planted coastal protection trees at locations where they
                had been planted before (such as sea almond trees and cacti), bringing hope for the future of the
                coastal ecosystem.üå±

                The trip left Xanh with countless moments of coming together to do good deeds, bringing valuable
                contributions to the local community.

                On this trip, we had the opportunity to visit children in difficult circumstances in a mountainous
                district of Phu Yen. We made recycled lanterns by hand to give to the children here, hoping they would
                have a warm and meaningful Mid-Autumn Festival. In addition, we also cooked a delicious meal for the
                children using fresh ingredients, and held many stimulating games for children there.

                In the chilly atmosphere of winter, the concert "Dong Khong Lanh" brought a warm flame that warmed the
                hearts of hundreds of attendees. Held on December 7th, 2024, at Gozo Coffee, the event was not only a
                musical performance but also a bridge that connected the community, coming together to support Mai am

                At this event, we successfully organized an acoustic live show to raise funds. In addition, we sold
                handmade products such as woolen teddy bears, velvet Christmas trees, and delicate bracelets, all
                crafted with care and skill. We also featured eco-friendly products, including sustainable skincare
                items made from fresh cactus extracts, provided by our sponsor, Organic Nopal Vietnam Joint Stock
                Company.

                The fundraising concert "Dong Khong Lanh - Tinh Nguoi Suoi Am" held on December 7th was a great success.
                The organizing committee would like to express our deepest gratitude to our generous sponsors,
                benefactors, and nearly 150 attendees who were present, followed, and supported our music night.

                The success of the "Dong Khong Lanh" concert is a clear testament to the power of unity and mutual
                support. The entire amount of money raised will be used to support charitable activities at Mai am Chua
                Hai Son in Song Cau Town at the beginning of 2025, helping bring a little love to the children at the
                temple.
