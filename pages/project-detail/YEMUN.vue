                    The moment has finally arrived. The new generation of YE-MUN members gathered in one place, meeting
                    each other in person for the first time. Everyone was happy and eagerly anticipating. The sound of
                    laughter and chatter filled the Sunday morning atmosphere.

                Returning once again this year, the YE-MUN 2024 Conference is adorned with a new theme: POSTERITY. Here,
                young people, with the heart and spirit of the Vietnamese, will debate global issues and bring the
                national voice to the international stage. Focusing on four main councils: the United Nations General
                Assembly (UNGA), the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations
                Security Council (UNSC), and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), participants
                will have the opportunity to demonstrate their mettle, express their individuality, and break free from
                the constraints that have long held them back.

                    the prom room with the pride of victory. Applause echoed throughout the room, as everyone engaged in
                    conversations, introductions, award presentations, and deep emotions, mingled with a hint of radiant
                    wistfulness. At that moment, everything was incredibly beautiful. It’s a memory that will likely
